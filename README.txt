Let's compare two different cases:

amount = 150
Greedy time: 0.000031 sec
Dynamic time: 0.001808 sec

amount = 150 000
Greedy time: 0.000032 sec
Dynamic time: 2.039296 sec

Based on the provided information, it's clear that the greedy algorithm has significantly lower execution time, regardless of the amount.
The dynamic algorithm shows a significant increase in execution time when the amount is larger. 

In summary, the dynamic algorithm may not be as efficient for larger amounts compared to the greedy algorithm. 
Thus when performance is critical the greedy algorithm is more preferabe. But the dynamic algorithm provides the optimal solution,
so if optimality is crucial, the dynamic programming approach is applicable.
